        # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
        - img/
        - assets/
          #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

          # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

          # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
          # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
          # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
          # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
